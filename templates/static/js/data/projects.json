    "challenges" : "Much of the challenge with this app came with formatting and handling data in a way that worked with different dependencies, as well as two languages. Getting the graphs to load quickly and efficiently is still a challenge I aim to overcome.",

    "improvements" : "I would like to add sliders that dynamically allows you to change settings. Possibly allow users to create an account that saves your watchlist and email for a personalized experience. I also would like to find a way to graph the data more efficiently by caching prices, and creating a more responsive graph."

    "challenges" : "I wanted to make everything run without needing to reload the page. This led me to writing my first app with JavaScript. While syntax was never an issue, getting a grip on the JavaScript/HTML interaction was tough. In order to create many horses, I wrote a loop in javascript to create the appropriate HTML code. This allowed me to create a self made horse component to copy, as the UI for each horse was gonna be the same",

    "code" : "https://github.com/Matthew-Simanonis/horse-bets",
    "improvements" : "I think this page could use a design update. It was one of my first webpages and it is pretty clunky. Making this with React would make my life alot easier so I may re-create the app from scratch."

    "challenges" : "This was my first real program. So naturally everything was a challenge. A big one was how to find album anniversaries in a common format and the possibility of albums with the same name. Though not the beste solution I used BeautifulSoup 4, a Python library that can scrape HTML. I scraped wikipedia for dates and saved them to a CSV. Unfortunately Wikipedia uses different URL formats for albums, so the program had to test for different formats. Sometime with the artist name, sometimes with \"(album)\" at the end. Using 5 queries I was able to accurately grab release dates for the requested albums. When I returned to this app a few months later, I wanted to add the Album Cover art to the notification. Here I used the Wikipedia API to grab a summary of the album, and the image url, which then could be saved and sent via email.",

    "challenges" : "It was defintetly a challenged to try and make my site look pretty, functional and do something that would stand out. I also wanted to create my own carousel, so making that was a learning experience. To create my carousel of projects I wanted to avoid using an existing library, as I enjoy the customizability of something you create yourself, and many of these libraries didnt allow for drag scrolling. I solved this with a clever use of overflow scrolling, and some JavaScript to create arrows.",
